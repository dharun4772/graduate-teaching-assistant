Worked with students in helping them understand the assignments and guiding them in the process to make the concepts of supervised machine learning understandable.
Regularly attended office hours to discuss with students about their progress in the assignments and also suggesting them changes to be made to get the best results.
Often had meetings with the professor and other teaching assistants to make modifications to the syllabus and assignments.
Directed a large number of students in the right direction especially for job applications for internships.
